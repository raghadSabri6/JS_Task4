### Comparing Fetch and Axios

Comparing how Fetch and Axios work, they're quite similar but have some differences. Here are the main ones:

- **Installation:**
  - Axios is like a separate tool you can easily add to your project.
  - Fetch comes already included in most new web browsers, so you don't have to add anything extra.

- **Data Handling:**
  - Axios automatically changes data to and from JSON.
  - With fetch(), you have to use response.json() to change the data to a JavaScript object.

- **Response Object:**
  - Axios gives you the data in the response object.
  - fetch() gives you the whole response object, which has other details like status, headers, and URL.

- **Error Handling:**
  - If something goes wrong, Axios deals with it in the catch block.
  - fetch() only says there's a problem if there's a network issue, not if the response has an error status.
